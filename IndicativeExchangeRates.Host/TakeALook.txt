If I am sorting in memory with a high level language, I choose Quick Sort first and Heap Sort second if the data is in nearly sorted order.

Comparing the fast ones, however, it seems that Quicksort is the favorite since Merge sort requires additional memory for doing its 
magic and Heapsort needs a preprocessing before performing the actual operation. Quicksort does a fast sorting and it does it in-place. 
That is why, most standard libraries of modern languages use Quicksort.
